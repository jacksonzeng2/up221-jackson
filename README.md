Hi, I'm Jackson Zeng! I'm a 2nd-year MURP student concentrating in transportation policy and planning. I grew up in Colorado and my hometown is Centennial. This course will teach us the foundations of Python and GIS to perform spatial data analyses and create maps and other visualizations for planning practices and research. My project ideas include creating a map of street intersections that have vehicle crashes above a certain threshold and a map of streets that have Class IV buffered bike lanes. My objectives for the class include become more comfortable in Python coding and becoming proficient in using Python and GIS to generate maps and visualizations for planning purposes.
